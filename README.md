This project focuses on designing a single-cycle RISC-V CPU using Verilog. It encompasses several key components essential for the CPU's operation:​

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with Flags: Performs fundamental arithmetic and logic operations, incorporating flags to monitor specific conditions like zero results or carry-out, crucial for decision-making processes within the CPU.​

Assembly to Machine Code Converter: Translates human-readable assembly instructions into machine code that the CPU can execute directly, bridging the gap between software instructions and hardware execution.​

Control Unit: Manages the execution of instructions by generating appropriate control signals, coordinating the operations of other components to ensure synchronized and correct instruction processing.​

Microarchitecture and Memory Initialization: Defines the CPU's internal organization and data flow. Proper memory initialization ensures that the CPU starts with a known state, facilitating predictable behavior during operations
